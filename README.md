# WoodTek ERP — Furniture Service Center

Next.js 16 (standalone) + PostgreSQL shop-floor ERP.

## Layout
- `src/` — app source (single source of truth)
- `start-prod.cjs` — watchdog launcher (auto-restart, health probe, port-conflict handling)
- `start-woodtek-prod.bat` — interactive launcher (double-click)
- `start-woodtek-prod-silent.bat` — background launcher used by the scheduled task
- `scripts/`, `backup/` — build + database backup/restore helpers
- `drizzle/` — DB schema migrations
- `RUNBOOK.txt` — one-page safety & update ritual
- `woodtek-snapshot.bat` — dated zip snapshot before any change

## Build & run (on the factory PC)
```
npm install                 (once)
node scripts\build-prod.cjs
start-woodtek-prod.bat      (or the scheduled task runs the silent bat)
```

## Role behaviour (since 2026-09-07)
- Machine Operator: sidebar shows only Operator Station Mode, Scrap & Rework,
  Workforce & Shifts; Active Role Persona panel hidden; PIN switch kept.
- Manager: Routing Recipes, Downtime Log, Workforce & Shifts, PIMS Import and
  Shop Floor Monitor are grouped under General Settings.
- Matrix lives in `src/lib/moduleAccess.ts`; enforced by sidebar + page guard.

## Update flow
Changes are committed and pushed to this repo. On the factory PC:
```
git pull
node scripts\build-prod.cjs
(restart the server)
```
`.env`, `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `logs/`, `backups/` are NOT tracked.
